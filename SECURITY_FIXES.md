# Security Fixes Applied

## Critical Issues Fixed ✅

### 1. CWE-94 - Code Injection (CRITICAL)
**Location**: `admin-public/script.js` lines 25-59
**Fix**: Added `sanitizeHtml()` function to escape all user inputs in template literals
- Sanitized resort name, location, price, and image URLs
- Prevented XSS attacks through HTML injection

### 2. CWE-352 - Cross-Site Request Forgery (HIGH)
**Locations**: All server files and client scripts
**Fix**: Implemented CSRF protection across all endpoints
- Added `csurf` middleware to all servers
- Added CSRF token endpoints: `/api/csrf-token`
- Updated all state-changing requests to include `X-CSRF-Token` header
- Protected POST, PUT, PATCH, DELETE operations

### 3. CWE-862 - Missing Authorization (HIGH)
**Locations**: Multiple server endpoints
**Fix**: Added authentication middleware
- Created `requireAuth()` function for protected endpoints
- Added authorization checks to admin operations
- Protected file upload endpoints

### 4. CWE-117 - Log Injection (HIGH)
**Locations**: All server files
**Fix**: Sanitized logging output
- Replaced direct object logging with `JSON.stringify()`
- Limited logged data to essential fields only
- Prevented log manipulation attacks

### 5. CWE-306 - Missing Authentication (HIGH)
**Location**: `api-gateway.js`
**Fix**: Added authentication requirements
- Protected critical gateway endpoints
- Added token validation middleware

## Medium Priority Issues Fixed ✅

### 6. Shell Script Carriage Returns
**Location**: `start-services.sh`
**Fix**: Created `start-services-fixed.sh` without carriage returns
- Removed Windows line endings
- Improved cross-platform compatibility

### 7. CORS Configuration
**All servers**
**Fix**: Restricted CORS origins
- Changed from wildcard `*` to specific allowed origins
- Added environment variable support for `ALLOWED_ORIGINS`

## Security Dependencies Added

```json
{
  "csurf": "^1.11.0",
  "helmet": "^7.1.0", 
  "express-rate-limit": "^7.1.5",
  "express-validator": "^7.0.1"
}
```

## Implementation Notes

1. **CSRF Tokens**: All forms must now fetch CSRF tokens before submission
2. **Authentication**: Admin operations require Authorization header
3. **Input Sanitization**: All user inputs are escaped before display
4. **Logging**: Sensitive data is no longer logged in plain text
5. **CORS**: Origins are restricted to known domains

## Next Steps (Recommended)

1. Install security dependencies: `npm install csurf helmet express-rate-limit express-validator`
2. Set environment variables for `ALLOWED_ORIGINS`
3. Implement proper user authentication system
4. Add rate limiting to prevent brute force attacks
5. Set up HTTPS in production
6. Regular security audits with `npm audit`
