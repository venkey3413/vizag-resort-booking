# EventBridge SSE Connection Fix

## Problem
EventBridge SSE connection was failing with `ERR_INCOMPLETE_CHUNKED_ENCODING` error, causing real-time updates to not work properly.

## Solution Applied

### 1. Fixed SSE Headers
- Added proper `Transfer-Encoding: chunked` header
- Set correct `Content-Type: text/event-stream; charset=utf-8`
- Improved CORS configuration

### 2. Enhanced Connection Management
- Reduced ping interval from 30s to 15s for better connection stability
- Added proper connection cleanup and error handling
- Improved dead client detection and removal

### 3. Added Debugging
- Added health check endpoint: `GET /api/health`
- Enhanced logging for SSE connections
- Created test script for SSE connection verification

## Quick Start

1. **Install dependencies:**
   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

2. **Setup environment:**
   ```bash
   npm run setup
   ```

3. **Start all servers:**
   ```bash
   npm run start-all
   ```

4. **Test EventBridge connection:**
   ```bash
   npm run test-sse
   ```

## Verification

1. Open booking management panel: http://localhost:3002
2. Check browser console for EventBridge connection messages
3. Create a test booking and verify real-time updates work
4. Check health endpoint: http://localhost:3002/api/health

## Fallback Mechanism

If EventBridge still fails, the system automatically:
- Falls back to direct HTTP notifications between servers
- Uses polling every 5 seconds as last resort
- Continues normal operation without real-time features

## Files Modified

- `booking-server.js` - Fixed SSE implementation
- `package.json` - Added new scripts and dependencies
- `server.js` - Added error handling for missing dependencies
- `admin-server.js` - Added missing node-fetch import

## New Files Added

- `start-all.js` - Unified server startup script
- `test-sse.js` - SSE connection testing script
- `setup.js` - Environment setup verification
- `fix-eventbridge.md` - Detailed fix documentation

The EventBridge SSE connection should now work properly with improved stability and error handling.
