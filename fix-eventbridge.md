# EventBridge SSE Connection Fix

## Issue
The EventBridge SSE connection is failing with `ERR_INCOMPLETE_CHUNKED_ENCODING` error.

## Root Cause
The SSE (Server-Sent Events) connection is not properly handling chunked encoding and connection timeouts.

## Fixes Applied

### 1. Improved SSE Headers
- Added proper `Transfer-Encoding: chunked` header
- Set `Content-Type: text/event-stream; charset=utf-8`
- Added proper CORS headers

### 2. Connection Management
- Reduced ping interval from 30s to 15s
- Added proper connection cleanup
- Improved error handling for dead connections

### 3. CORS Configuration
- Added proper CORS middleware
- Added OPTIONS handler for preflight requests

### 4. Health Check
- Added `/api/health` endpoint to monitor SSE clients

## Testing

1. **Start the servers:**
   ```bash
   npm run start-all
   ```

2. **Test SSE connection:**
   ```bash
   npm run test-sse
   ```

3. **Check health:**
   ```bash
   curl http://localhost:3002/api/health
   ```

## Manual Testing

1. Open browser console on booking management page
2. Check for EventBridge connection messages
3. Verify real-time updates work when bookings are created/updated

## Fallback Mechanism

If EventBridge still fails, the system will:
1. Use direct HTTP notifications between servers
2. Fall back to polling every 5 seconds
3. Continue to function normally

## Next Steps

If issues persist:
1. Check network connectivity between servers
2. Verify firewall settings
3. Consider using WebSocket instead of SSE
4. Check browser compatibility
